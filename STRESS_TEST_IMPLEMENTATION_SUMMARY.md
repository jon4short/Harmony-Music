- **Updated AudioFlux Toggle Name**
  - Changed from "AudioFlux Key Detection" to "**Use Audio Flux Key Detection**"
  - Updated in `localization/en.json` for better user clarity
  - More descriptive and user-friendly terminology

### 3. 🧪 Comprehensive Stress Test Suite

#### Core Stress Test (`test/harmony_stress_test.dart`)
A robust, production-ready stress test that covers:

**🎧 Audio Handler Stress Tests**
- Rapid state changes (play/pause/seek operations)
- Queue management under load (add/remove/reorder operations)
- Concurrent audio operations testing

**🎛️ Settings Controller Tests**
- Rapid settings toggle operations
- Configuration persistence under stress
- Multi-threaded settings updates

**🗃️ Data Management Tests**
- Hive database concurrent operations
- Large data serialization performance
- Memory leak detection during data operations

**⚡ Performance Benchmarks**
- UI state update performance
- Concurrent future operations
- Widget rebuild stress testing

**🛡️ Error Handling Tests**
- Exception recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation testing
- Error rate analysis

**🎯 Integration Tests**
- Full application simulation
- Realistic user interaction patterns
- Multi-component stress testing

#### Test Configuration
```dart
class StressTestMetrics {
  static const int rapidOperations = 100;        // Rapid operation cycles
  static const int concurrentOperations = 25;    // Concurrent operations
  static const int memoryTestCycles = 30;        // Memory leak test cycles
  static const Duration testTimeout = Duration(minutes: 3);
}
```

### 4. 🚀 Test Execution Infrastructure

#### Simple Test Runner (`run_stress_tests.dart`)
- **Command-line interface** with multiple options
- **Performance metrics extraction** from test output
- **HTML report generation** with visual dashboard
- **Error analysis and reporting**

#### Usage Commands
```bash
# Run all stress tests with verbose output
dart run_stress_tests.dart --verbose

# Generate HTML report
dart run_stress_tests.dart --report

# Quick test run
dart run_stress_tests.dart

# Run tests directly with Flutter
flutter test test/harmony_stress_test.dart
```

### 5. 📊 Performance Monitoring

#### Metrics Tracked
- **Audio Operations**: Average response time per operation
- **Queue Management**: Operations per second, final queue integrity
- **Settings Changes**: Toggle response time, persistence verification
- **Database Operations**: Concurrent operation completion time
- **Memory Usage**: Memory growth patterns, leak detection
- **UI Performance**: Widget rebuild times, state update speed

#### Expected Performance Baselines
| Component | Target Performance | Max Acceptable |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Audio Operations | < 25ms avg | < 50ms |
| Queue Operations | < 100 ops/sec | < 50 ops/sec |
| Settings Toggle | < 10ms | < 20ms |
| Database Ops | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| UI Updates | < 16ms (60fps) | < 33ms (30fps) |

### 6. 📈 Reporting and Analysis

#### HTML Report Features
- **Visual dashboard** with performance metrics
- **Status indicators** (Pass/Fail with color coding)
- **Performance trends** and bottleneck identification
- **Error analysis** with detailed stack traces
- **Test execution timeline** and duration tracking

#### Generated Reports Include
